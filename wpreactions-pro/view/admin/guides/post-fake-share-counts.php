<p>Give your page some extra share counts. Users counts over 999 will show as 1K and will continue to round up by 100, i.e. 1.1K, 1.2K. Counts over 1 million will show as 1M, 1.1M, 1.2M and so on and so forth.</p><p>If you set up random share counts already, you can make changes by typing over the existing number.</p>
